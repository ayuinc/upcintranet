			<h3>About This Page</h3>
			
			<p>The "Delete Account" page allows the currently logged in user to delete their own account, as long as their member group has permissions to delete their own account, and they are not a Super Admin.</p>

			<p>It makes use of the following function:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://www.solspace.com/docs/detail/user_delete_form/">User:Delete_Form</a> to delete member accounts.</li>
			</ul>
