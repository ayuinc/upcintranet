Admin IP Lockdown?
File Monitor?
Exploit Scanner?
Security Scan?

Scan Requirements:
Rename "system"
Search for .svn folders and .git
Move system above webroot
Require encryption_key and validate length (32 characters)
Allow Dictionary Words as Passwords "Admin > System Preferences > Security and Session Preferences > Allow Dictionary Words as Passwords"
Always log into the CP via HTTPS... use .htaccess to enforce this.
CHMOD config.php to 644 or 444 to prevent EE from overwriting it
Check member usage and recommend changing member access template paramaters
Check EE version
Check add-on version(s)
Check for update.php 
Check EE security and log level

Check PHP for:
allow_url_fopen = Off ; Disable URLs for file handling functions
register_globals = Off ; Make sure this hellish fiend is dead
open_basedir = /var/www/htdocs/files ; Restrict file handling functions to a subdirectory????
